years experiance working on all Mercedes-Benz vehicles. We have the latest up to date diagnostic

equipment and special tools where required to ensure we can carry out any repairs on your car. We

have access to all the latest service schedule information and can be sure we carry out the correct

service on your Mercedes-Benz at the correct time. Mercdes-Benz service schedules are very unique,

in that there is no set interval or mileage for certain items. All this information is stored in the cars

on board computer as the car decides when and what is due for change dependent on many

variables. To be sure what service is due we can talk you through how to find the information if you

are not aware, on earlier vehicles it will be a letter A or B type service, and on later vehicles the

letters range from A to H. If you let us know which letter the car is displaying we can then quote

accordingly. This also means you may have to visit us more than once a year, but with free collection

and delivery or a free loan car we aim to make sure it doesn’t interfere with your plans to much.

Some of the services such as pollen filter changes, or brake fluid changes can also be carried out

while you wait as they only take around 45 minutes. We will also make sure that all the parts and

lubricants meet the Mercedes-Benz standard, and if you prefer we can give you prices to use

genuine parts and oil if you would prefer. Whether you have a Mercedes A class, Sprinter van or a

high performance SL63 AMG we can give you main dealer service at a fraction of the price !

            @*<h2>VAG Cambelt replacement</h2>
                <p>
                    90% of all the VAG vehicles still use a cambelt rather than a chain to drive the camshaft. The interval for these

                    is generally every 4 years or 60,000 miles up to 2009, and 5 years 100,000 there after. This is a basic guide and

                    if you require clarifiaction please contact us where we can confirm this using your registration number. We

                    also recommend that the water pump is replaced at the same time, as this is usually driven from the cambelt

                    and can also cause major engine damage if it fails. For a competitive price please call us on 02392 592010 or

                    email us at <a href="mailto:info@autobarnmotorservices.co.uk">info@autobarnmotorservices.co.uk</a>.

                <p>
                    Whilst all the recalls have to be carried out by a main dealer we are happy to advise you and can answer your

                    questions and quieries. We have lots of information regarding this issue and are happy to advise. We have

                    found that some vehicles when visiting the dealer are subject to a free health check where work required is

                    reported, we can again quote for any repairs advised and are happy to recheck for a second opinion if

                    required.
